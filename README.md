# RL-cognition-lab
Repo containing research materials and coding applications for my term project in CS6795:Cognitive Science in GaTech OMSCS. Focused on studying theories of embodied cognition in simple, simulated multi modal RL agents.

Currently experimenting with tabular and dqn RL models in cartpole toy environment on uni-modal inputs. 
All files in cartpole subfolder, training files and agent files seperate.
